## About this project

Planning to create a clone minesweeper game. Practice creating a java application with GUI using MVC pattern.

7/24/2025 Using labels seemed to make the board load instantly instead of buttons. The flood fill still can see individual loops happening.

To Do:
  Menus
  Mine counter
  Timer
  7 segment display for timer and counter?
  New Game button
